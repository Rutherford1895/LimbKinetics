# Limb Movement Kinetics
Mouse Lower limb movement's kinetics.

This project is done on a request of my friend. The demand is to draw the kinetics graph of a mouse's limb's movement. Beyond the demand, I also added a feature that can show the movement in animation.

I used **pandas** to process the data and **tkinter** for the visualization part, both based on Python 3.7.
